## 2. Loan Prediction:

Loan prediction using Logistic regresion and LDA.

- Results:
in comparison with the performance of the two algorithms used.
There is no confidence difference between their performance, As the logistic regression metric was
76.7% and the LDA metric was 75.5%.
The logistic regression is slightly better than the LDA algorithm.
